= Bearer Token Authentication and Authorization

Bearer Token Authorization is the process of authorizing HTTP requests based on the existence and validity of a bearer
token representing a subject and his access context, where the token provides valuable information to determine the subject of the call as well whether or not a HTTP resource
can be accessed.

Elytron supports bearer token authorization by providing a `BEARER_TOKEN` HTTP authentication mechanism based on https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750[RFC-6750] and
an specific `realm` implementation, the `token-realm`, to validate tokens using the JWT format (for instance, OpenID Connect ID Tokens) or opaque tokens issued by any OAuth2 compliant
authorization server.

== How it Works

When a HTTP request arrives to your application, the `BEARER_TOKEN` mechanism will check if a bearer token was provided by checking the existence of an `Authorization` HTTP header with the following format:

```bash
GET /resource HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Authorization: Bearer mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM
```

If no bearer token was provided, the mechanism will respond with a `401` HTTP status code as follows:

```bash
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="example"
```

When a bearer token is provided, the mechanism will extract the token from the request (in the example above, the token is represented by the string `mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM`) and pass it over
to the `token-realm` in order to check if the token is valid and can be used to build a security context based on its information. Note that the `BEARER_TOKEN` mechanism is only responsible to
check and extract bearer tokens from an HTTP request, whereas the `token-realm` is the one responsible for validating the token.

If validation succeeds, a security context will be created based on the information represented by the token and the application can use the newly created
security context to obtain information about the subject making the request as well decide whether or not the request should be full filled. In case the validation fails,
the mechanism will respond with a `403` HTTP status code as follows:

```bash
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
```

== Validating JWT Tokens

Elytron provides built-in support for JWT tokens, which can be enabled by defining a `realm` in the Elytron subsystem as follows:

```xml
 <token-realm name="JwtRealm" principal-claim="sub">
    <jwt issuer="as.example.com"
         audience="api.example.com"
         public-key="-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQCqGKukO1De7zhZj6+H0qtjTkVxwTCpvKe4eCZ0FPqri0cb2JZfXJ/DgYSF6vUpwmJG8wVQZKjeGcjDOL5UlsuusFncCzWBQ7RKNUSesmQRMSGkVb1/3j+skZ6UtW+5u09lHNsj6tQ51s1SPrCBkedbNf0Tp0GbMJDyR4e9T04ZZwIDAQAB-----END PUBLIC KEY-----"/>
 </token-realm>
```

In the example above, the `token-realm` is defined with a `principal-claim` attribute. This attribute specifies which claim
within the token should be used to identity the principal. If you have a token as follows:

```json
 {
   "iss": "as.example.com",
   "sub": "24400320",
   "aud": "s6BhdRkqt3",
   "exp": 1311281970,
   "nbf": 1311280970,
  }
```

Elytron will use the value associated with the `sub` claim as the identifier of the subject represented by the token.

The `jwt` element within the `token-realm` specifies that tokens should be validated as JWT and provides different configuration options on how they
should be validated:

* *issuer*
+
A list of strings representing the issuers supported by this configuration. During validation JWT tokens must have an "iss" claim that contains one of the values defined here
+
* *audience*
+
A list of strings representing the audiences supported by this configuration. During validation JWT tokens must have an "aud" claim that contains one of the values defined here
+
* *public-key*
+
A public key in PEM Format. During validation, if a public key is provided, signature will be verified based on the key you provided here

The `jwt` validator performs different checks in order to determine the validity of a JWT:

* Expiration checks based on the values of the `exp` and `nbf` claims
* Signature check when a `public-key` is provided

It is strongly recommended that you use signed JWTs in order to guarantee authenticity of tokens and make sure they were not tampered.

== Validating OAuth2 Bearer Tokens

Elytron provides built-in support for tokens issued by an OAuth2 compliant authorization server, where these tokens are validated
using a token introspection endpoint as defined by OAuth2 specification.

```xml
<token-realm name="OAuth2Realm" principal-claim="sub">
    <oauth2-introspection client-id="my-client-id"
                          client-secret="keep_it_secret"
                          introspection-url="https://as.example.com/token/introspect"
                          client-ssl-context="user-defined-ssl-context"
                          host-name-verification-policy="ANY" />
</token-realm>
```

The `auth2-introspection` element within the `token-realm` specifies that tokens should be validated using an OAuth2 Token Introspection Endpoint and provides different configuration options on how they
should be validated:

* *client-id*
+
The identifier of the client on the OAuth2 Authorization Server
+
* *client-secret*
+
The secret of the client
+
* *introspection-url*
+
The URL of token introspection endpoint
+
* *client-ssl-context*
+
The SSL context to be used if the introspection endpoint is using HTTPS.
+
* *host-name-verification-policy*
+
A policy that defines how host names should be verified when using HTTPS. Allowed values: "ANY".
